2] Certain amount of instances will already be on your ec2 service page
3] repeat the same process you do to create record for 70/30 ratio
4] Here, create the ratio of 40/40/20
5] Three records will be created, choose the weighted policy and define percentages in each record
	(you will see your ip will be changing as per the weighted ratio)

20. implemt nginx as a load balancer implent nginx as a proxy server

steps :-
1] first go to vpc select vpc and more 
2] create vpc with 1 public subnet and 1 private subnet and nat gateway attach to it 
3] internet gateway and route table are auto created and associated
4] click on create vpc 
5] go to security group and create security group and allow all traffic. (for demo only)
6] go to EC2 and click on launch templete 
7] create instance name my-web-server in private subnet and add below user data to launch apache server and launch instance 
	#!/bin/bash 
	sudo yum update -y
	sudo yum install httpd -y
	sudo systemctl start httpd
	sudo systemctl enable httpd 
	echo " This is my apache server" > /var/www/html/index.html 
8] again launch second instance in public subnet 
9] connect to the instance which is created in public subnet
10] update the instance
11] and install nginx on it
12] access the private instance on public instance using ssh 
12] to access private instance copy the key pair which we selected when we created te instance 
13] past the key pair in instance and give "400" permission to file (command : chmod 400 key.pem)
14] use command "ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@ ip-addr" to connect to private instance 
14] use 'curl localhost' to see if the server are launched or not
14] change the port of server from 80 to 8080 ( command : cd /etc/http/conf/httpd.conf)
16] edit listen 80  to listen 8080
17] go back to instance in which nginx is configer 
18] go to file "cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/default" and edit location 
19] go to location block and add " proxy_pass http://ip-of-apache-server:8080;" and save it and reload nginx
20] copy public ip of nginx instance and hit in the search bar and see nginx works as loadbalancer

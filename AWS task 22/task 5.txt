4. impelement autoscaling with load balancer with the same ami which we have created earliar scaling policy should be on memory utilization.

steps -
1] go to IAM and create a IAM role for ec2-full-access-to-cloudwatch
2] go to aws search bar and search for the system manager
3] go to parameter store and create parameter to store memory utilization matrix written in json code.
{
	"metrics": {
		"append_dimensions": {
			 "AutoScalingGroupName":"${!aws:AutoScalingGroupName}"
		},
		"metrics_collected": {
			"mem": {
				"measurement": [
					"mem_used_percent"
				],
				"metrics_collection_interval": 60
			}
		}
	}
}
4] past the above code in value section in create parameter page and save it
5] now the parameter is created and go to ec2.
6] go to autoscaling and create the auto scaling group 
7] in launch templete launch the templete and in templete choose advance setting 
8] attach iam role we created and in user data add below script

#!/bin/bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/linux/amd64/latest/AmazonCloudWatchAgent.zip
unzip AmazonCloudWatchAgent.zip
sudo ./install.sh
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -c ssm:/alarm/AWS-CWAgentLinConfig -s

9] above user data is to install cloud-watch agent and this user data contain
10] install cloudwhatch-agent zip file using wget.
11] unzip the zip file.
12] and run the file ./install.sh
13]and in the last section configuring the cloud watch agent (it fetch the cloud watch agent fron the ssm we created)
14] and create the templete and attach it to the autoscaling 
15] attach loadbalancer to auto scaling group and target group will auto created by it and create the autoscaling group.
16] wait to set up the instance after the instance is set up connect to it.
17] now check if the ec2 instance has the cloudwatch agent installed and running in it or not.
18] now go to cloud watch and go to matrix
19] click on CWagent that will apear after we install cloud watch agent 
20] there will be the memory utilization matrox we created.
21] now go to alarm and select create alarm 
22] go to select matrix and select memory utilization matrix we created.
23] now configer the matrix condition and create the alarm.
24] it wll show infficient data status after some time it will show ok state 
25] if tou set the alarm condition to greater then 60 then if mem util go over 60 it will be in alarm state.
